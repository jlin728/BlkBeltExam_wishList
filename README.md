The purpose of the project is to that let users create new items for their wishlist and to view and add other user's wishlist items to their own list.

Project consists of two separate apps, one that handles Login/Registration, the other for populating and manipulating the database.

Login/Registration has validations and uses bcrypt/gensalt to protect passwords.
Database app also has validations that restrict what the user can or cannot do.
